  "fullText": "Clause 18                             Insurance\n   The wording in the General Conditions describes the insurances which are to be arranged by the\n   \"insuring Party\", who is to be the Contractor unless otherwise stated in the Particular Conditions.\n   Insurances so provided by the Contractor are to be consistent with the general terms agreed with\n   the Employer. The Instructions to Tenderers may therefore require tenderers to provide details of the\n   proposed terms.\n\n   If the Employer is to arrange any of the insurances under this Clause, the tender documents should\n   include details as an annex to the Particular Conditions (so that tenderers can estimate what other\n   insurances they wish to have for their own protection), including the conditions, limits, exceptions\n   and deductibles; preferably in the form of a copy of each policy. The Employer may find it difficult\n   to effect the insurances described in the third paragraph of Sub-Clause 18.2 (for Contractor's\n   Equipment, which includes Subcontractor's equipment), because the Employer may not know the\n   amount or value of these items of equipment. The following sentence may be included in the\n   Particular Conditions:\n\n   EXAMPLE                            Delete the final paragraph of Sub-Clause 18.2 and substitute:\n                                      However, the insurances described in the first two paragraphs of Sub-\n                                      Clause 18.2 shall be effected and maintained by the Employer as\n                                      insuring Party, and not by the Contractor.",
