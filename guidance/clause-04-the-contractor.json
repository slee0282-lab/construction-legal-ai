  "fullText": "Clause 4                               The Contractor\n        Sub-Clause 4.1                     Contractor's General Obligations\n\n        Occasionally, there may be an item of Temporary Works for which the Contractor will not be fully\n        responsible. For example, the Contract may specify temporary arrangements for river diversion\n        which have been designed by the Engineer. In these cases, the Sub-Clause may require\n        amendment, taking account of the type of this item of Temporary Works, and of the extent of the\n        Employer's responsibility.\n\n        Sub-Clause 4.2                     Performance Security\n\n        The acceptable form(s) of Performance Security should be included in the tender documents,\n        annexed to the Particular Conditions. Example forms are annexed to this document as Annex C\n        and Annex D. They incorporate two sets of Uniform Rules published by the International Chamber\n        of Commerce (the \"ICC\", which is based at 38 Cours Albert 1er, 75008 Paris, France), which also\n        publishes guides to these Uniform Rules. These example forms and the wording of the Sub-Clause\n        may have to be amended to comply with applicable law.\n\n        EXAMPLE                            At the end of the second paragraph of Sub-Clause 4.2, insert:\n                                           If the Performance Security is in the form of a bank guarantee, it shall\n                                           be issued either (a) by a bank located in the Country, or (b) directly by a\n                                           foreign bank acceptable to the Employer. If the Performance Security is\n                                           not in the form of a bank guarantee, it shall be furnished by a financial\n                                           entity registered, or licensed to do business, in the Country.\n\n        Sub-Clause 4.3                     Contractor's Representative\n\n        If the Representative is known at the time of submission of the Tender, the Tenderer may propose\n        the Representative. The Tenderer may wish to propose alternatives, especially if the contract award\n        seems likely to be delayed. If the ruling language is not the same as the language for day to day\n        communications (under Sub-Clause 1.4), or if for any other reason it is necessary to stipulate that\n        the Contractor's Representative shall be fluent in a particular language, one of the following\n        sentences may be added.\n\n        EXAMPLE                            At the end of Sub-Clause 4.3, add:\n\n                                           The Contractor's Representative and all these persons shall also be\n                                           fluent in               (insert name of language)\n\n        EXAMPLE                            At the end of Sub-Clause 4.3, add:\n                                           If the Contractor's Representative, or these persons, is not fluent in\n                                                             (insert name of language), the Contractor shall make a\n                                           competent interpreter available during all working hours.\n\n        Sub-Clause 4.4                     Subcontractors\n\n        The wording in the General Conditions includes the conditions which will usually be applicable. If\n        less (or no) consent is required, some (or all) of sub-paragraphs (a) to (d) may be deleted, or\n        qualified in the Particular Conditions:\n6       except: example text between lines may be copied\n\fEXAMPLE\n                                   Prior consent shall not be required if the value of the subcontract is less\n                                   than 0.01% of the Accepted Contract Amount.\n\nA sentence may be added to increase the extent to which consent is required:\n\nEXAMPLE\n                                   The prior consent of the Engineer shall be obtained to the suppliers of\n                                   the following Materials:\n\n                                   (insert details: for example, specific manufactured or prefabricated items)\n\nA sentence may be added in order to encourage the Contractor to use local contractors:\n\nEXAMPLE\n                                   Where practicable, the Contractor shall give a fair and reasonable\n                                   opportunity for contractors from the Country to be appointed as Sub-\n                                   contractors.\n\nSub-Clause 4.8                     Safety Procedures\n\nIf the Contractor is sharing occupation of the Site with others, it may not be appropriate for him to\nprovide some of the listed items. In these circumstances, the Employer's obligations should be\nspecified.\n\nSub-Clause 4.9                     Quality Assurance\n\nThe wording in the General Conditions imposes the requirement of a quality assurance system\nin accordance with details specified in the Contract.
