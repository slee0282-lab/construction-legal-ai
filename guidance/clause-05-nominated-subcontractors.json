Clause 5 provides for the particular situation whereby the Employer may\n        select a Subcontractor, although the second sentence of Sub-Clause 4.4 should still apply.\n\n        The sub-paragraphs of Sub-Clause 5.2 indicate some of the problems which may have to be overcome.\n\n        If a nominated Subcontractor is to be required, full details should be included in the tender\n        documents. If the Employer anticipates that a Subcontractor is to be instructed under Clause 13\n        but is not to be a nominated Subcontractor, Clause 5 should be amended, describing the particular\n        circumstances.",
