  "fullText": "Clause 13                              Variations and Adjustments\n\n    Variations can be initiated by any of three ways:\n\n    (a)     the Engineer may instruct the variation under Sub-Clause 13.1, without prior agreement as\n            to feasibility or price;\n    except: example text between lines may be copied                                                       11\n\f        (b)      the Contractor may initiate his own proposals under Sub-Clause 13.2, which are intended\n                 to benefit both Parties; or\n\n        (c)      the Engineer may request a proposal under Sub-Clause 13.3, seeking prior agreement so\n                 as to minimise dispute.\n        Sub-Clause 13.8                     Adjustments for Changes in Cost\n        These provisions for adjustments may be required if it would be unreasonable for the Contractor to\n        bear the risk of escalating costs due to inflation. Unless this Sub-Clause is not to apply, the\n        Appendix to Tender should include a table for each of the currencies of payment: the appropriate\n        table is shown in the example Appendix. Particular care should be taken in the calculation of the\n        weightings/coefficients (\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", ..., the total of which must not exceed unity) and in the\n        selection and verification of cost indices. Expert advice may be appropriate.",
