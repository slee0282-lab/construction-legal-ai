  "fullText": "Clause 20                             Claims, Disputes and Arbitration\n   Sub-Clause 20.2                    Appointment of the Dispute Adjudication Board\n\n   Unless the Engineer (although appointed by the Employer) is to make the pre-arbitral decisions\n   under this Clause 20, in accordance with the alternative option described below, the Contract\n   should include the provisions under Clause 20 which, whilst not discouraging the Parties from\n   reaching agreement on disputes as the works proceed, allow them to refer contentious matters to\n   an impartial dispute adjudication board (\"DAB\").\n\n   The adjudication procedure depends for its success on, amongst other things, the Parties'\n   confidence in the agreed individual(s) who will serve on the DAB. Therefore, it is essential that\n   candidates for this position are not imposed by either Party on the other Party; and that, if the\n   individual is selected under Sub-Clause 20.3, the selection is made by a wholly impartial entity.\n   FIDIC is prepared to perform this role, if this authority has been delegated in accordance with the\n   example wording in the Appendix to Tender.\n\n   It is preferable, but not essential, for the individual(s) to be agreed before the Letter of Acceptance\n   is issued, and for the DAB to visit the Site on a regular basis. Under the example text in the\n   Appendix to Tender, the Parties may either so agree before the Letter of Acceptance is issued or\n   agree the appointment within the specified period thereafter. Alternatively, the Parties may prefer\n   to defer the appointment until a dispute has arisen, in which case Sub-Clause 20.2 plus the\n   Appendix - General Conditions of Dispute Adjudication Agreement with its Annex (Procedural\n   Rules) and the Dispute Adjudication Agreement should be amended to comply with the wording\n   except: example text between lines may be copied                                                     19\n\f     contained in the corresponding sections of FIDIC’s Conditions of Contract for Plant and Design -\n     Build.\n\n     Sub-Clause 20.2 provides for two alternative arrangements for the DAB:\n\n     (a)     one person, who acts as the sole member of the DAB, having entered into a tripartite\n             agreement with both Parties; or\n\n     (b)     a DAB of three persons, each of whom has entered into a tripartite agreement with both Parties.\n\n     The form of this tripartite agreement could be one of the two alternatives shown at the end of this\n     publication, as appropriate to the arrangement adopted. Both of these forms incorporate (by\n     reference) the General Conditions of Dispute Adjudication Agreement, which are included as the\n     Appendix to the General Conditions because they are also referred to in Sub-Clause 20.2. Under\n     either of these alternative forms of Dispute Adjudication Agreement, each individual person is\n     referred to as a Member.\n\n     At an early stage, consideration should be given as to whether a one-person or three-person DAB\n     is preferable for a particular project, taking account of its size, duration and the fields of expertise\n     which will be involved. For some projects, it may be considered appropriate to appoint a one-\n     person DAB for each major field of expertise relevant to the Works; however, this may give rise to\n     problems if, when a dispute arises, the Parties cannot agree which field is applicable and, there-\n     fore, to whom the dispute should be referred.\n\n     For a one-person DAB to be mutually agreed, the Employer (or the tenderer) could propose the\n     names and curriculum vitae of suitable persons, for the tenderer (or the Employer) to accept. It may\n     be advisable to propose alternates in case some subsequently decline the appointment, assuming\n     that they have not previously indicated their willingness to accept. Each Party may be reluctant to\n     choose names from a list of people who have already been contacted by the other Party.\n\n     For a three-person DAB, the Employer and the tenderer may each propose one member, similar to\n     the above procedure, for the tenderer and the Employer respectively to accept. For the chairman, the\n     Employer (or the tenderer) could similarly propose suitable persons for the tenderer (or the Employer)\n     to accept. It may be appropriate for the chairman's retainer fee to be more than that of the other two\n     members, reflecting the additional administrative tasks which a chairman will have to perform.\n\n     The appointment of the DAB may be facilitated, especially if the members are not to be appointed\n     at the commencement of the Contract, by including an agreed list of potential members in the\n     Contract: in a Schedule.\n\n     Alternatively, the Engineer may make these pre-arbitral decisions. This alternative, which has been\n     the Engineer's traditional role in common law countries, may be appropriate if the Engineer is an\n     independent professional consulting en",
