  "fullText": "Clause 14                              Contract Price and Payment\n        Sub-Clause 14.1                     The Contract Price\n\n        When writing the Particular Conditions, consideration should be given to the amount and timing of\n        payment(s) to the Contractor. A positive cash flow is clearly of benefit to the Contractor, and\n        tenderers will take account of the interim payment procedures when preparing their tenders.\n\n        Additional Sub-Clauses may be required to cover any exceptions to the options set out in Sub-\n        Clause 14.1, and any other matters relating to payment.\n\n        Cost-plus contracts, under which the actual Costs are determined and paid, are unusual and only\n        used when (for reasons of urgency or otherwise) the Employer is willing to accept the risks\n        involved. If the Contractor is to be paid actual Costs, Clause 12 should be replaced by provisions\n        describing the method of determining the Costs and Contract Price. As a result, the provisions in\n        the General Conditions which entitle the Contractor to payment of additional Costs will generally\n        be of no effect.\n\n\n        Sub-Clause 14.1(a) would not apply if payment is to be made on a lump sum basis.\n\n        Lump sum contracts may be suitable if the tender documents include details which are sufficiently\n        complete for construction and for Variations to be unlikely. From the information supplied in the\n        tender documents, the Contractor can prepare any other details necessary, and construct the\n        Works, without having to refer back to the Engineer for clarification or further information.\n\n        Further design by the Contractor (under sub-paragraphs (a) to (d) of Sub-Clause 4.1) is not\n        precluded. However, these Conditions would be inappropriate if significant design input by the\n        Contractor is required. In those cases, FIDIC's other forms may be more appropriate: see FIDIC's\n        Conditions of Contract for Plant and Design-Build or Conditions of Contract for EPC/Turnkey\n        Projects.\n\n        For a lump sum contract, the tender documents should include a schedule of payments (see Sub-\n        Clause 14.4), and any drawings required for construction may be specified as being Contractor's\n        Documents. The Specification should describe the procedures under which the Contractor submits\n        these Documents for the Engineer to approve.\n\n        EXAMPLE PROVISIONS FOR A LUMP SUM CONTRACT\n\n                                            Delete Clause 12.\n                                            Delete the last sentence of Sub-Clause 13.3 and substitute:\n12       except: example text between lines may be copied\n\f                                   Upon instructing or approving a Variation, the Engineer shall proceed in\n                                   accordance with Sub-Clause 3.5 to agree or determine adjustments to\n                                   the Contract Price and to the schedule of payments under Sub-Clause\n                                   14.4. These adjustments shall include reasonable profit, and shall take\n                                   account of the Contractor's submissions under Sub-Clause 13.2 if\n                                   applicable.\n\n                                   Delete sub-paragraph (a) of Sub-Clause 14.1 and substitute:\n\n                                   (a)      the Contract Price shall be the lump sum Accepted Contract\n                                            Amount and be subject to adjustments in accordance with the\n                                            Contract;\n\nIf Sub-Clause 14.1(b) is not to apply, additional Sub-Clause(s) should be added.\n\nEXAMPLE SUB-CLAUSE ON EXEMPTION FROM DUTIES\n\n                                   All Goods imported by the Contractor into the Country shall be exempt\n                                   from customs and other import duties, if the Employer's prior written\n                                   approval is obtained for import.
