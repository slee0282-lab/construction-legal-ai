If the Accepted Contract Amount\n         is to be quoted as the sum of figures in more than one currency, it may be preferable to define these\n         damages (per day) as the percentage reduction which would be applied to each of these figures. If\n         the Accepted Contract Amount is expressed in the Local Currency, the damages per day may either\n         be defined as a percentage or be defined as a figure in Local Currency: see Sub-Clause 14.15(b).\n\n         Additional Sub-Clause\n\n         Incentives for early completion may be included in the tender documents (although Sub-Clause\n         13.2 refers to accelerated completion):\n10       except: example text between lines may be copied\n\f    EXAMPLE SUB-CLAUSE\n                                       Sections are required to be completed by the dates given in the\n                                       Appendix to Tender in order that these Sections may be occupied and\n                                       used by the Employer in advance of the completion of the whole of the\n                                       Works.
