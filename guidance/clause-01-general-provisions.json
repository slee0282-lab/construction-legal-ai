  "fullText": "Clause 1                             General Provisions\n         Sub-Clause 1.1                  Definitions\n\n         It may be necessary to amend some of the definitions. For example:\n\n         1.1.3.1           the Base Date could be defined as a particular calendar date\n         1.1.4.6           one particular Foreign Currency may be required by the financing institution\n         1.1.4.8           a different currency may be required to be the contract Local Currency\n         1.1.6.2           the references to \"Country\" may be inappropriate for a cross-border Site\n\n         Sub-Clause 1.2                  Interpretation\n\n         If the references to \"profit\" are to be more precisely specified, this Sub-Clause may be varied:\n\n         EXAMPLE                         At the end of Sub-Clause 1.2, insert:\n                                         In these Conditions, provisions including the expression \"Cost plus\n                                         reasonable profit\" require this profit to be one-twentieth (5%) of this Cost.\n\n         Sub-Clause 1.5                  Priority of Documents\n\n         An order of precedence is usually necessary, in case a conflict is subsequently found among the\n         contract documents. If no order of precedence is to be prescribed, this Sub-Clause may be\n         varied:\n\n         EXAMPLE                         Delete Sub-Clause 1.5 and substitute:\n                                         The documents forming the Contract are to be taken as mutually\n                                         explanatory of one another. If an ambiguity or discrepancy is found, the\n                                         priority shall be such as may be accorded by the governing law. The\n                                         Engineer has authority to issue any instruction which he considers\n                                         necessary to resolve an ambiguity or discrepancy.\n\n         Sub-Clause 1.6                  Contract Agreement\n\n         The form of Agreement should be included in the tender documents as an annex to the Particular\n         Conditions: an example form is included at the end of this publication. If lengthy tender\n         negotiations were necessary, it may be considered advisable for the Contract Agreement to\n         record the Accepted Contract Amount, Base Date and/or Commencement Date. Entry into an\n         Agreement may be necessary under applicable law.\n\n         Sub-Clause 1.14                    Joint and Several Liability\n\n         For a major contract, detailed requirements for the joint venture may need to be specified. For\n         example, it may be desirable for each member to produce a parent company guarantee: an\n         example form is annexed to this document as Annex A.\n\n         These requirements, which apply prior to the Contract becoming effective, should be included in\n         the Instructions to Tenderers. The Employer will wish the leader of the joint venture to be\n         appointed at an early stage, providing a single point of contact thereafter, and will not wish to be\n         involved in a dispute between the members of a joint venture. The Employer should scrutinise the\n4     except: example text between lines may be copied\n\f    joint venture agreement carefully, and it may have to be approved by the project's financing\n    institutions.\n\n    Additional Sub-Clause Details to be Confidential\n\n    If confidentiality is required, an additional sub-clause may be added:\n\n    EXAMPLE SUB-CLAUSE\n                                       The Contractor shall treat the details of the Contract as private and\n                                       confidential, except to the extent necessary to carry out obligations\n                                       under it or to comply with applicable Laws. The Contractor shall not\n                                       publish, permit to be published, or disclose any particulars of the Works\n                                       in any trade or technical paper or elsewhere without the previous\n                                       agreement of the Employer.",
