FOREWORD

The Fédération Internationale des Ingénieurs-Conseils (FIDIC) published, in 1999, First
Editions of four new standard forms of contract:

Conditions of Contract for Construction,
      which are recommended for building or engineering works designed by the
      Employer or by his representative, the Engineer. Under the usual arrangements
      for this type of contract, the Contractor constructs the works in accordance
      with a design provided by the Employer. However, the works may include some
      elements of Contractor-designed civil, mechanical, electrical and/or
      construction works.

Conditions of Contract for Plant and Design-Build,
      which are recommended for the provision of electrical and/or mechanical plant,
      and for the design and execution of building or engineering works. Under the
      usual arrangements for this type of contract, the Contractor designs and
      provides, in accordance with the Employer’s requirements, plant and/or other
      works; which may include any combination of civil, mechanical, electrical
      and/or construction works.

Conditions of Contract for EPC/Turnkey Projects,
      which may be suitable for the provision on a turnkey basis of a process or
      power plant, of a factory or similar facility, or of an infrastructure project or other
      type of development, where (i) a higher degree of certainty of final price and
      time is required, and (ii) the Contractor takes total responsibility for the design
      and execution of the project, with little involvement of the Employer. Under the
      usual arrangements for turnkey projects, the Contractor carries out all the
      Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC), providing a fully-equipped
      facility, ready for operation (at the “turn of the key”).

Short Form of Contract,
      which is recommended for building or engineering works of relatively small
      capital value. Depending on the type of work and the circumstances, this form
      may also be suitable for contracts of greater value, particularly for relatively
      simple or repetitive work or work of short duration. Under the usual
      arrangements for this type of contract, the Contractor constructs the works in
      accordance with a design provided by the Employer or by his representative (if
      any), but this form may also be suitable for a contract which includes, or wholly
      comprises, Contractor-designed civil, mechanical, electrical and/or
      construction works.

The forms are recommended for general use where tenders are invited on an
international basis. Modifications may be required in some jurisdictions, particularly if
the Conditions are to be used on domestic contracts. FIDIC considers the official and
authentic texts to be the versions in the English language.

In the preparation of these Conditions of Contract for Construction, it was recognised
that, while there are many sub-clauses which will be generally applicable, there are
some sub-clauses which must necessarily vary to take account of the circumstances
relevant to the particular contract. The sub-clauses which were considered to be
applicable to many (but not all) contracts have been included in the General
Conditions, in order to facilitate their incorporation into each contract.

The General Conditions and the Particular Conditions will together comprise the
Conditions of Contract governing the rights and obligations of the parties. It will be
necessary to prepare the Particular Conditions for each individual contract, and to
take account of those sub-clauses in the General Conditions which mention the
Particular Conditions.

For this publication, the General Conditions were prepared on the following basis:

(i)     interim and final payments will be determined by measurement, applying the
        rates and prices in a Bill of Quantities;

(ii)    if the wording in the General Conditions necessitates further data, then (unless
        it is so descriptive that it would have to be detailed in the Specification) the sub-
        clause makes reference to this data being contained in the Appendix to Tender,
        the data either being prescribed by the Employer or being inserted by the
        Tenderer;

(iii)   where a sub-clause in the General Conditions deals with a matter on which
        different contract terms are likely to be applicable for different contracts, the
        principles applied in writing the sub-clause were:

        (a)    users would find it more convenient if any provisions which they did not
               wish to apply could simply be deleted or not invoked, than if additional
               text had to be written (in the Particular Conditions) because the General
               Conditions did not cover their requirements; or

        (b)    in other cases, where the application of (a) was thought to be
               inappropriate, the sub-clause contains the provisions which were
               considered applicable to most contracts.

For example, Sub-Clause 14.2 [Advance Payment] is included for convenience, not
because of any FIDIC policy in respect of advance payments. This Sub-Clause
becomes inapplicable (even if it is not deleted) if it is disregarded by not specifying the
amount of the advance. It should therefore be noted that some of the provisions
contained in the General Conditions may not be appropriate for an apparently-typical
contract.

Further information on these aspects, example wording for other arrangements, and
other explanatory material and example wording to assist in the preparation of the
Particular Conditions and the other tender documents, are included within this
publication as Guidance for the Preparation of the Particular Conditions. Before
incorporating any example wording, it must be checked to ensure that it is wholly
suitable for the particular circumstances; if not, it must be amended.

Where example wording is amended, and in all cases where other amendments or
additions are made, care must be taken to ensure that no ambiguity is created, either
with the General Conditions or between the clauses in the Particular Conditions. It is
essential that all these drafting tasks, and the entire preparation of the tender
documents, are entrusted to personnel with the relevant expertise, including the
contractual, technical and procurement aspects.

This publication concludes with example forms for the Letter of Tender, the Appendix
to Tender (providing a check-list of the sub-clauses which refer to it), the Contract
Agreement, and alternatives for the Dispute Adjudication Agreement. This Dispute
Adjudication Agreement provides text for the agreement between the Employer, the
Contractor and the person appointed to act either as sole adjudicator or as a member
of a three-person dispute adjudication board; and incorporates (by reference) the
terms in the Appendix to the General Conditions.

FIDIC intends to publish a guide to the use of its Conditions of Contract for
Construction, for Plant and Design-Build, and for EPC/Turnkey Projects. Another
relevant FIDIC publication is “Tendering Procedure”, which presents a systematic
approach to the selection of tenderers and the obtaining and evaluation of tenders.

In order to clarify the sequence of Contract activities, reference may be made to the
charts on the next two pages and to the Sub-Clauses listed below (some Sub-Clause
numbers are also stated in the charts). The charts are illustrative and must not be
taken into consideration in the interpretation of the Conditions of Contract.

Typical sequence of Principal Events during Contracts for Construction

1.      The Time for Completion is to be stated (in the Appendix to Tender) as a number of days, to which is added
        any extensions of time under Sub-Clause 8.4.
2.      In order to indicate the sequence of events, the above diagram is based upon the example of the Contractor
        failing to comply with Sub-Clause 8.2.
3.      The Defects Notification Period is to be stated (in the Appendix to Tender) as a number of days, to which is
        added any extensions under Sub-Clause 11.3

    Guidance for the Preparation of Particular Conditions

    INTRODUCTION

    The terms of the Conditions of Contract for Construction have been prepared by the Fédération
    Internationale des Ingénieurs-Conseils (FIDIC) and are recommended for general use for the
    purpose of the construction (excluding most design) of building or engineering works where tenders
    are invited on an international basis. Modifications to the Conditions may be required in some legal
    jurisdictions, particularly if they are to be used on domestic contracts.

    Under the usual arrangements for this type of contract, the Contractor constructs the works in
    accordance with design details provided by the Employer or his representative, the Engineer.
    Although these Conditions allow for the possibility that the Contractor may be required to design
    parts of the permanent works, they are not intended for use where most of the works are designed
    by the Contractor. For these Works, it would be more appropriate to utilise FIDIC's Conditions of
    Contract for Plant and Design-Build or Conditions of Contract for EPC/Turnkey Projects.

    The guidance hereafter is intended to assist writers of the Particular Conditions by giving options
    for various sub-clauses where appropriate. As far as possible, example wording is included,
    between lines. In some cases, however, only an aide-memoire is given.

    Before incorporating any example wording, it must be checked to ensure that it is wholly suitable
    for the particular circumstances. Unless it is considered suitable, example wording should be
    amended before use.

    Where example wording is amended, and in all cases where other amendments or additions are
    made, care must be taken to ensure that no ambiguity is created, either with the General Conditions
    or between the clauses in the Particular Conditions.

    In the preparation of the Conditions of Contract to be included in the tender documents for a
    contract, the following text can be used:

          The Conditions of Contract comprise the "General Conditions", which form part of the
          "Conditions of Contract for Construction" First Edition 1999 published by the
          Fédération Internationale des Ingénieurs-Conseils (FIDIC), and the following "Particular
          Conditions", which include amendments and additions to such General Conditions.

    There are no Sub-Clauses in the General Conditions which require data to be included in the
    Particular Conditions. As noted in sub-paragraph (ii) of the Foreword, the General Conditions refer
    to any necessary data being contained in the Appendix to Tender or (for technical matters) in the
    Specification.

    FIDIC has published a document entitled "Tendering Procedure" which presents a systematic
    approach to the selection of tenderers and the obtaining and evaluation of tenders; the second
    edition was published in 1994. The document is intended to assist the Employer to receive sound
    competitive tenders with a minimum of qualifications. FIDIC intends to update Tendering Procedure
    and to publish a guide to the use of these Conditions of Contract for Construction.

Notes on the Preparation of Tender Documents
The tender documents should be prepared by suitably-qualified engineers who are familiar with the
technical aspects of the required works, and a review by suitably-qualified lawyers may be
advisable. The tender documents issued to tenderers will consist of the Conditions of Contract, the
Specification, the Drawings, and the Letter of Tender and Schedules for completion by the Tenderer.
For this type of contract, where the Works are valued by measurement, the Bill of Quantities will
usually be the most important Schedule. A Daywork Schedule may also be necessary, to cover
minor works to be evaluated at cost. In addition, each of the Tenderers should receive the data
referred to in Sub-Clause 4.10, and the Instructions to Tenderers to advise them of any special
matters which the Employer wishes them to take into account when pricing the Bill of Quantities
but which are not to form part of the Contract. When the Employer accepts the Letter of Tender,
the Contract (which then comes into full force and effect) includes these completed Schedules.

The Specification may include the matters referred to in some or all of the following Sub-Clauses:
      1.8 Requirements for Contractor's Documents
      1.13 Permissions being obtained by the Employer
      2.1 Phased possession of foundations, structures, plant or means of access
      4.1 Contractor's designs
      4.6 Other contractors (and others) on the Site
      4.7 Setting-out points, lines and levels of reference
      4.14 Third parties
      4.18 Environmental constraints
      4.19 Electricity, water, gas and other services available on the Site
      4.20 Employer's Equipment and free-issue material
      5.1 Nominated Subcontractors
      6.6 Facilities for Personnel
      7.2 Samples
      7.4 Testing during manufacture and/or construction
      9.1 Tests on Completion
      13.5 Provisional Sums

Many Sub-Clauses in the General Conditions make reference to data being contained in the
Appendix to Tender, providing a convenient location for the data which is usually required. The
example form in this publication thus provides a check-list of the data required; but there is no
indication, either in the General Conditions or in the example Appendix to Tender, that this data is
either prescribed by the Employer or inserted by the Tenderer. The Employer should prepare the
Appendix to Tender, based on this example form, with the elements completed to the extent of his
requirements.

The Employer may also require other data from Tenderers, and include a questionnaire in the
Schedules.

The Instructions to Tenderers may need to specify any constraints on the completion of the
Appendix to Tender and/or Schedules, and/or specify the extent of other information which each
Tenderer is to include with his Tender. If each Tenderer is to produce a parent company guarantee
and/or a tender security, these requirements (which apply prior to the Contract becoming effective)
should be included in the Instructions to Tenderers: example forms are annexed to this document
as Annexes A and B. The Instructions may include matters referred to in some or all of the following
Sub-Clauses:

      4.3    Contractor's Representative (name and curriculum vitae)
      4.9    Quality Assurance system
      9.1    Tests on Completion
      18     Insurances
      20     Resolution of disputes
                                                                                                     3
    Clause 1                             General Provisions
         Sub-Clause 1.1                  Definitions

         It may be necessary to amend some of the definitions. For example:

         1.1.3.1           the Base Date could be defined as a particular calendar date
         1.1.4.6           one particular Foreign Currency may be required by the financing institution
         1.1.4.8           a different currency may be required to be the contract Local Currency
         1.1.6.2           the references to "Country" may be inappropriate for a cross-border Site

         Sub-Clause 1.2                  Interpretation

         If the references to "profit" are to be more precisely specified, this Sub-Clause may be varied:

         EXAMPLE                         At the end of Sub-Clause 1.2, insert:
                                         In these Conditions, provisions including the expression "Cost plus
                                         reasonable profit" require this profit to be one-twentieth (5%) of this Cost.

         Sub-Clause 1.5                  Priority of Documents

         An order of precedence is usually necessary, in case a conflict is subsequently found among the
         contract documents. If no order of precedence is to be prescribed, this Sub-Clause may be
         varied:

         EXAMPLE                         Delete Sub-Clause 1.5 and substitute:
                                         The documents forming the Contract are to be taken as mutually
                                         explanatory of one another. If an ambiguity or discrepancy is found, the
                                         priority shall be such as may be accorded by the governing law. The
                                         Engineer has authority to issue any instruction which he considers
                                         necessary to resolve an ambiguity or discrepancy.

         Sub-Clause 1.6                  Contract Agreement

         The form of Agreement should be included in the tender documents as an annex to the Particular
         Conditions: an example form is included at the end of this publication. If lengthy tender
         negotiations were necessary, it may be considered advisable for the Contract Agreement to
         record the Accepted Contract Amount, Base Date and/or Commencement Date. Entry into an
         Agreement may be necessary under applicable law.

         Sub-Clause 1.14                    Joint and Several Liability

         For a major contract, detailed requirements for the joint venture may need to be specified. For
         example, it may be desirable for each member to produce a parent company guarantee: an
         example form is annexed to this document as Annex A.

         These requirements, which apply prior to the Contract becoming effective, should be included in
         the Instructions to Tenderers. The Employer will wish the leader of the joint venture to be
         appointed at an early stage, providing a single point of contact thereafter, and will not wish to be
         involved in a dispute between the members of a joint venture. The Employer should scrutinise the
4     except: example text between lines may be copied
    joint venture agreement carefully, and it may have to be approved by the project's financing
    institutions.

    Additional Sub-Clause Details to be Confidential

    If confidentiality is required, an additional sub-clause may be added:

    EXAMPLE SUB-CLAUSE
                                       The Contractor shall treat the details of the Contract as private and
                                       confidential, except to the extent necessary to carry out obligations
                                       under it or to comply with applicable Laws. The Contractor shall not
                                       publish, permit to be published, or disclose any particulars of the Works
                                       in any trade or technical paper or elsewhere without the previous
                                       agreement of the Employer.



Clause 2                               The Employer
    Sub-Clause 2.1                     Right of Access to the Site

    If right of access cannot be granted, both early and thereafter exclusively, details should be given
    in the Specification.

    Sub-Clause 2.3                     Employer's Personnel

    These provisions should be reflected in the Employer's contracts with any other contractors on the Site.


Clause 3                               The Engineer
    Sub-Clause 3.1                     Engineer's Duties and Authority

    Any requirements for Employer's approval should be set out in the Particular Conditions:

    EXAMPLE
                                       The Engineer shall obtain the specific approval of the Employer before
                                       taking action under the following Sub-Clauses of these Conditions:

                                       (a)         Sub-Clause                      **

                                       (b)         Sub-Clause                      **

                                       ** (insert number; describe action, unless all require approval)

    This list should be extended or reduced as necessary. If the obligation to obtain the approval of the
    Employer only applies beyond certain limits, financial or otherwise, the example wording should be
    varied.

    Additional Sub-Clause Management Meetings

    EXAMPLE SUB-CLAUSE
                                       The Engineer or the Contractor's Representative may require the other
                                       to attend a management meeting in order to review the arrangements for
                                       future work. The Engineer shall record the business of management
                                       meetings and supply copies of the record to those attending the meeting
    except: example text between lines may be copied                                                          5
                                           and to the Employer. In the record, responsibilities for any actions to be
                                           taken shall be in accordance with the Contract.


    Clause 4                               The Contractor
        Sub-Clause 4.1                     Contractor's General Obligations

        Occasionally, there may be an item of Temporary Works for which the Contractor will not be fully
        responsible. For example, the Contract may specify temporary arrangements for river diversion
        which have been designed by the Engineer. In these cases, the Sub-Clause may require
        amendment, taking account of the type of this item of Temporary Works, and of the extent of the
        Employer's responsibility.

        Sub-Clause 4.2                     Performance Security

        The acceptable form(s) of Performance Security should be included in the tender documents,
        annexed to the Particular Conditions. Example forms are annexed to this document as Annex C
        and Annex D. They incorporate two sets of Uniform Rules published by the International Chamber
        of Commerce (the "ICC", which is based at 38 Cours Albert 1er, 75008 Paris, France), which also
        publishes guides to these Uniform Rules. These example forms and the wording of the Sub-Clause
        may have to be amended to comply with applicable law.

        EXAMPLE                            At the end of the second paragraph of Sub-Clause 4.2, insert:
                                           If the Performance Security is in the form of a bank guarantee, it shall
                                           be issued either (a) by a bank located in the Country, or (b) directly by a
                                           foreign bank acceptable to the Employer. If the Performance Security is
                                           not in the form of a bank guarantee, it shall be furnished by a financial
                                           entity registered, or licensed to do business, in the Country.

        Sub-Clause 4.3                     Contractor's Representative

        If the Representative is known at the time of submission of the Tender, the Tenderer may propose
        the Representative. The Tenderer may wish to propose alternatives, especially if the contract award
        seems likely to be delayed. If the ruling language is not the same as the language for day to day
        communications (under Sub-Clause 1.4), or if for any other reason it is necessary to stipulate that
        the Contractor's Representative shall be fluent in a particular language, one of the following
        sentences may be added.

        EXAMPLE                            At the end of Sub-Clause 4.3, add:

                                           The Contractor's Representative and all these persons shall also be
                                           fluent in               (insert name of language)

        EXAMPLE                            At the end of Sub-Clause 4.3, add:
                                           If the Contractor's Representative, or these persons, is not fluent in
                                                             (insert name of language), the Contractor shall make a
                                           competent interpreter available during all working hours.

        Sub-Clause 4.4                     Subcontractors

        The wording in the General Conditions includes the conditions which will usually be applicable. If
        less (or no) consent is required, some (or all) of sub-paragraphs (a) to (d) may be deleted, or
        qualified in the Particular Conditions:
6       except: example text between lines may be copied
EXAMPLE
                                   Prior consent shall not be required if the value of the subcontract is less
                                   than 0.01% of the Accepted Contract Amount.

A sentence may be added to increase the extent to which consent is required:

EXAMPLE
                                   The prior consent of the Engineer shall be obtained to the suppliers of
                                   the following Materials:

                                   (insert details: for example, specific manufactured or prefabricated items)

A sentence may be added in order to encourage the Contractor to use local contractors:

EXAMPLE
                                   Where practicable, the Contractor shall give a fair and reasonable
                                   opportunity for contractors from the Country to be appointed as Sub-
                                   contractors.

Sub-Clause 4.8                     Safety Procedures

If the Contractor is sharing occupation of the Site with others, it may not be appropriate for him to
provide some of the listed items. In these circumstances, the Employer's obligations should be
specified.

Sub-Clause 4.9                     Quality Assurance

The wording in the General Conditions imposes the requirement of a quality assurance system
in accordance with details specified in the Contract. If inappropriate, this Sub-Clause may be
deleted.

Sub-Clause 4.12                    Unforeseeable Physical Conditions

In the case of major sub-surface works, the allocation of the risk of sub-surface conditions is an
aspect which should be considered when tender documents are being prepared. If this risk is to be
shared between the parties, the Sub-Clause may be amended:

EXAMPLE                            Delete sub-paragraph (b) of Sub-Clause 4.12 and substitute:
                                   (b)      payment for any such Cost,             per cent (         %) of
                                            which shall be included in the Contract Price (the balance
                                                      percent of the Cost shall be borne by the Contractor).

Sub-Clause 4.17                    Contractor's Equipment

If the Contractor is not to provide all the Contractor's Equipment necessary to complete the Works,
the Employer's obligations should be specified: see Sub-Clause 4.20. If vesting of Contractor's
Equipment is required, further paragraphs may be added, subject to their being consistent with
applicable laws:

EXAMPLE                            At the end of Sub-Clause 4.17, add the following paragraphs:

                                   Contractor's Equipment which is owned by the Contractor (either
                                   directly or indirectly) shall be deemed to be the property of the
                                   Employer with effect from its arrival on the Site. This vesting of property
                                   shall not:
except: example text between lines may be copied                                                                 7
                                           (a)     affect the responsibility or liability of the Employer,

                                           (b)     prejudice the right of the Contractor to the sole use of the vested
                                                   Contractor's Equipment for the purpose of the Works, or

                                           (c)     affect the Contractor's responsibility to operate and maintain
                                                   Contractor's Equipment.

                                           The property in each item shall be deemed to revest in the Contractor
                                           when he is entitled either to remove it from the Site or to receive the
                                           Taking-Over Certificate for the Works, whichever occurs first.

        Sub-Clause 4.19                    Electricity, Water and Gas

        If services are to be available for the Contractor to use, the Specification should give details,
        including locations and prices.

        Sub-Clause 4.20                    Employer's Equipment and Free-Issue Material

        For this Sub-Clause to apply, the Specification should describe each item which the Employer will
        provide and/or operate and should specify all necessary details. With some types of facilities,
        further provisions may be necessary, in order to clarify aspects such as liability and insurance.

        Sub-Clause 4.22                    Security of the Site

        If the Contractor is sharing occupation of the Site with others, it may not be appropriate for him
        to be responsible for its security. In these circumstances, the Employer's obligations should be
        specified.


    Clause 5                               Nominated Subcontractors
        In most cases under Sub-Clause 4.4, the Contractor selects Subcontractors, subject to any constraints
        specified in the Contract. Clause 5 provides for the particular situation whereby the Employer may
        select a Subcontractor, although the second sentence of Sub-Clause 4.4 should still apply.

        The sub-paragraphs of Sub-Clause 5.2 indicate some of the problems which may have to be overcome.

        If a nominated Subcontractor is to be required, full details should be included in the tender
        documents. If the Employer anticipates that a Subcontractor is to be instructed under Clause 13
        but is not to be a nominated Subcontractor, Clause 5 should be amended, describing the particular
        circumstances.


    Clause 6                               Staff and Labour
        Sub-Clause 6.5                     Working Hours

        If the Employer does not wish to specify working hours in the Appendix to Tender, or to restrict
        them to the times specified by the Tenderer (in order to plan the Engineer's supervision, for
        example), this Sub-Clause may be deleted.

        Sub-Clause 6.6                     Facilities for Staff and Labour

        If the Employer will make some accommodation available, his obligations to do so should be
        specified.

Sub-Clause 6.8                     Contractor's Superintendence

If the ruling language is not the same as the language for day to day communications (under Sub-
Clause 1.4), or if for any other reason it is necessary to stipulate that the Contractor's
superintending staff shall be fluent in a particular language, the following sentence may be
added.

EXAMPLE
                                   Insert at the end of Sub-Clause 6.8:
                                   A reasonable proportion of the Contractor's superintending staff shall
                                   have a working knowledge of

                                   (insert name of language),

                                   or the Contractor shall have a sufficient number of competent
                                   interpreters available on Site during all working hours.

Additional Sub-Clauses

It may be necessary to add a few sub-clauses to take account of the circumstances and locality of
the Site:

EXAMPLE SUB-CLAUSE

                                   Foreign Staff and Labour

                                   The Contractor may import any personnel who are necessary for the
                                   execution of the Works. The Contractor must ensure that these
                                   personnel are provided with the required residence visas and work
                                   permits. The Contractor shall be responsible for the return to the place
                                   where they were recruited or to their domicile of imported Contractor's
                                   Personnel. In the event of the death in the Country of any of these
                                   personnel or members of their families, the Contractor shall similarly be
                                   responsible for making the appropriate arrangements for their return or
                                   burial.

EXAMPLE SUB-CLAUSE

                                   Measures against Insect and Pest Nuisance

                                   The Contractor shall at all times take the necessary precautions to
                                   protect all staff and labour employed on the Site from insect and pest
                                   nuisance, and to reduce their danger to health. The Contractor shall
                                   provide suitable prophylactics for the Contractor's Personnel and shall
                                   comply with all the regulations of the local health authorities, including
                                   use of appropriate insecticide.

EXAMPLE SUB-CLAUSE

                                   Alcoholic Liquor or Drugs

                                   The Contractor shall not, otherwise than in accordance with the Laws of
                                   the Country, import, sell, give, barter or otherwise dispose of any
                                   alcoholic liquor or drugs, or permit or allow importation, sale, gift, barter
                                   or disposal by Contractor's Personnel.
except: example text between lines may be copied                                                              9
         EXAMPLE SUB-CLAUSE
                                            Arms and Ammunition

                                            The Contractor shall not give, barter or otherwise dispose of to any
                                            person, any arms or ammunition of any kind, or allow Contractor's
                                            Personnel to do so.

         EXAMPLE SUB-CLAUSE

                                            Festivals and Religious Customs

                                            The Contractor shall respect the Country's recognised festivals, days of
                                            rest and religious or other customs.



     Clause 7                               Plant, Materials and Workmanship

         Additional Sub-Clause

         If the Contract is being financed by an institution whose rules or policies require a restriction on the
         use of its funds, a further sub-clause may be added:

         EXAMPLE SUB-CLAUSE
                                            All Goods shall have their origin in eligible source countries as defined in

                                            (insert name of published guidelines for procurement).

                                            Goods shall be transported by carriers from these eligible source
                                            countries, unless exempted by the Employer in writing on the basis of
                                            potential excessive costs or delays. Surety, insurance and banking
                                            services shall be provided by insurers and bankers from the eligible
                                            source countries.



     Clause 8                               Commencement, Delays and Suspension
         Sub-Clause 8.2                     Time for Completion

         If the Works are to be taken-over in stages, these stages should be defined as Sections, in the
         Appendix to Tender.

         Sub-Clause 8.7                     Delay Damages

         Under many legal systems, the amount of these pre-defined damages must represent a reasonable
         pre-estimate of the Employer's probable loss in the event of delay. If the Accepted Contract Amount
         is to be quoted as the sum of figures in more than one currency, it may be preferable to define these
         damages (per day) as the percentage reduction which would be applied to each of these figures. If
         the Accepted Contract Amount is expressed in the Local Currency, the damages per day may either
         be defined as a percentage or be defined as a figure in Local Currency: see Sub-Clause 14.15(b).

         Additional Sub-Clause

         Incentives for early completion may be included in the tender documents (although Sub-Clause
         13.2 refers to accelerated completion):
10       except: example text between lines may be copied
    EXAMPLE SUB-CLAUSE
                                       Sections are required to be completed by the dates given in the
                                       Appendix to Tender in order that these Sections may be occupied and
                                       used by the Employer in advance of the completion of the whole of the
                                       Works. Details of the work required to be executed to entitle the
                                       Contractor to bonus payments and the amount of the bonuses are
                                       stated in the Specification.

                                       For the purposes of calculating bonus payments, the dates given in the
                                       Appendix to Tender for completion of Sections are fixed. No adjustments
                                       of the dates by reason of granting an extension of the Time for
                                       Completion will be allowed.


Clause 9                               Tests on Completion

    Sub-Clause 9.1                     Contractor's Obligations

    The Specification should describe the tests which the Contractor is to carry out before being entitled
    to a Taking-Over Certificate. If the Works are to be tested and taken-over in stages, the tests
    requirements may have to take account of the effect of some parts of the Works being incomplete.


Clause 10                              Employer's Taking Over
    Sub-Clause 10.1                    Taking-Over Certificate

    If the Works are to be taken-over in stages, these stages should to be defined as Sections, in the
    Appendix to Tender. Precise geographical definitions are advisable, and the Appendix should
    include a table, so as to define the Time for Completion and delay damages: the table is shown in
    the example Appendix.


Clause 11                              Defects Liability
    Sub-Clause 11.10                   Unfulfilled Obligations

    It may be necessary to review this Sub-Clause for the period of liability imposed by the applicable law.


Clause 12                              Measurement and Evaluation
    Sub-Clause 12.1                    Works to be Measured

    If any part of the Permanent Works is to be measured according to records of its construction,
    details should be specified in the tender documents, including any records for which the Contractor
    is to be responsible.


Clause 13                              Variations and Adjustments

    Variations can be initiated by any of three ways:

    (a)     the Engineer may instruct the variation under Sub-Clause 13.1, without prior agreement as
            to feasibility or price;
    except: example text between lines may be copied                                                       11
        (b)      the Contractor may initiate his own proposals under Sub-Clause 13.2, which are intended
                 to benefit both Parties; or

        (c)      the Engineer may request a proposal under Sub-Clause 13.3, seeking prior agreement so
                 as to minimise dispute.
        Sub-Clause 13.8                     Adjustments for Changes in Cost
        These provisions for adjustments may be required if it would be unreasonable for the Contractor to
        bear the risk of escalating costs due to inflation. Unless this Sub-Clause is not to apply, the
        Appendix to Tender should include a table for each of the currencies of payment: the appropriate
        table is shown in the example Appendix. Particular care should be taken in the calculation of the
        weightings/coefficients ("a", "b", "c", ..., the total of which must not exceed unity) and in the
        selection and verification of cost indices. Expert advice may be appropriate.


     Clause 14                              Contract Price and Payment
        Sub-Clause 14.1                     The Contract Price

        When writing the Particular Conditions, consideration should be given to the amount and timing of
        payment(s) to the Contractor. A positive cash flow is clearly of benefit to the Contractor, and
        tenderers will take account of the interim payment procedures when preparing their tenders.

        Additional Sub-Clauses may be required to cover any exceptions to the options set out in Sub-
        Clause 14.1, and any other matters relating to payment.

        Cost-plus contracts, under which the actual Costs are determined and paid, are unusual and only
        used when (for reasons of urgency or otherwise) the Employer is willing to accept the risks
        involved. If the Contractor is to be paid actual Costs, Clause 12 should be replaced by provisions
        describing the method of determining the Costs and Contract Price. As a result, the provisions in
        the General Conditions which entitle the Contractor to payment of additional Costs will generally
        be of no effect.


        Sub-Clause 14.1(a) would not apply if payment is to be made on a lump sum basis.

        Lump sum contracts may be suitable if the tender documents include details which are sufficiently
        complete for construction and for Variations to be unlikely. From the information supplied in the
        tender documents, the Contractor can prepare any other details necessary, and construct the
        Works, without having to refer back to the Engineer for clarification or further information.

        Further design by the Contractor (under sub-paragraphs (a) to (d) of Sub-Clause 4.1) is not
        precluded. However, these Conditions would be inappropriate if significant design input by the
        Contractor is required. In those cases, FIDIC's other forms may be more appropriate: see FIDIC's
        Conditions of Contract for Plant and Design-Build or Conditions of Contract for EPC/Turnkey
        Projects.

        For a lump sum contract, the tender documents should include a schedule of payments (see Sub-
        Clause 14.4), and any drawings required for construction may be specified as being Contractor's
        Documents. The Specification should describe the procedures under which the Contractor submits
        these Documents for the Engineer to approve.

        EXAMPLE PROVISIONS FOR A LUMP SUM CONTRACT

                                            Delete Clause 12.
                                            Delete the last sentence of Sub-Clause 13.3 and substitute:
12       except: example text between lines may be copied
                                   Upon instructing or approving a Variation, the Engineer shall proceed in
                                   accordance with Sub-Clause 3.5 to agree or determine adjustments to
                                   the Contract Price and to the schedule of payments under Sub-Clause
                                   14.4. These adjustments shall include reasonable profit, and shall take
                                   account of the Contractor's submissions under Sub-Clause 13.2 if
                                   applicable.

                                   Delete sub-paragraph (a) of Sub-Clause 14.1 and substitute:

                                   (a)      the Contract Price shall be the lump sum Accepted Contract
                                            Amount and be subject to adjustments in accordance with the
                                            Contract;

If Sub-Clause 14.1(b) is not to apply, additional Sub-Clause(s) should be added.

EXAMPLE SUB-CLAUSE ON EXEMPTION FROM DUTIES

                                   All Goods imported by the Contractor into the Country shall be exempt
                                   from customs and other import duties, if the Employer's prior written
                                   approval is obtained for import. The Employer shall endorse the
                                   necessary exemption documents prepared by the Contractor for
                                   presentation in order to clear the Goods through Customs, and shall also
                                   provide the following exemption documents:

                                   (describe the necessary documents, which the Contractor will be unable
                                   to prepare)

                                   If exemption is not then granted, the customs duties payable and paid
                                   shall be reimbursed by the Employer.

                                   All imported Goods, which are not incorporated in or expended in
                                   connection with the Works, shall be exported on completion of the
                                   Contract. If not exported, the Goods will be assessed for duties as
                                   applicable to the Goods involved in accordance with the Laws of the
                                   Country.

                                   However, exemption may not available for:

                                   (a)      Goods which are similar to those locally produced, unless they are
                                            not available in sufficient quantities or are of a different standard to
                                            that which is necessary for the Works; and

                                   (b)      any element of duty or tax inherent in the price of goods or
                                            services procured in the Country, which shall be deemed to be
                                            included in the Accepted Contract Amount.

                                   Port dues, quay dues and, except as set out above, any element of tax
                                   or duty inherent in the price of goods or services shall be deemed to be
                                   included in the Accepted Contract Amount.

EXAMPLE SUB-CLAUSE ON EXEMPTION FROM TAXES

                                   Expatriate (foreign) personnel shall not be liable for income tax levied in
                                   the Country on earnings paid in any foreign currency, or for income tax
                                   levied on subsistence, rentals and similar services directly furnished by
                                   the Contractor to Contractor's Personnel, or for allowances in lieu. If any
except: example text between lines may be copied                                                                13
                                        Contractor's Personnel have part of their earnings paid in the
                                        Country in a foreign currency, they may export (after the conclusion
                                        of their term of service on the Works) any balance remaining of their
                                        earnings paid in foreign currencies.

                                        The Employer shall seek exemption for the purposes of this Sub-
                                        Clause. If it is not granted, the relevant taxes paid shall be
                                        reimbursed by the Employer.

     Sub-Clause 14.2                    Advance Payment

     When writing the Particular Conditions, consideration should be given to the benefits of
     advance payment(s). Unless this Sub-Clause is not to apply, the total advance payment (and
     the number of instalments if more than one) must be specified in the Appendix to Tender. The
     rate of deduction for the repayments should be checked to ensure that repayment is achieved
     before completion. The typical figures in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of the General Conditions
     Sub-Clause are based on the assumption that the total advance payment is less than 22% of
     the Accepted Contract Amount.

     The acceptable form(s) of guarantee should be included in the tender documents, annexed to
     the Particular Conditions: an example form is annexed to this document, as Annex E.

     Sub-Clause 14.7                    Payment

     If a different period for payment is to apply, the Sub-Clause may be amended:

     EXAMPLE
                                        In sub-paragraph (b) of Sub-Clause 14.7, delete "56" and substitute
                                        "42"

     If the country/countries of payment need to be specified, details may be included in a Schedule.

     Sub-Clause 14.8                    Delayed Payment

     If the discount rate of the central bank in the country of the currency of payment is not a
     reasonable basis for assessing the Contractor's financing costs, a new rate may have to be
     defined. Alternatively, the actual financing Costs could be paid, taking account of local financing
     arrangements.

     Sub-Clause 14.9                    Payment of Retention Money

     If part of the Retention Money is to be released and substituted by an appropriate guarantee,
     an additional Sub-Clause may be added. The acceptable form(s) of guarantee should be
     included in the tender documents, annexed to the Particular Conditions: an example form is
     annexed to this document, as Annex F.

     EXAMPLE SUB-CLAUSE FOR RELEASE OF RETENTION

                                        When the Retention Money has reached three-fifths (60%) of the limit
                                        of Retention Money stated in the Appendix to Tender, the Engineer
                                        shall certify and the Employer shall make payment of half (50%) of
                                        the limit of Retention Money to the Contractor if he obtains a
                                        guarantee, in a form and provided by an entity approved by the
                                        Employer, in amounts and currencies equal to the payment.

                                        The Contractor shall ensure that the guarantee is valid and
14   except: example text between lines may be copied
                                        enforceable until the Contractor has executed and completed the Works
                                        and remedied any defects, as specified for the Performance Security in
                                        Sub-Clause 4.2, and shall be returned to the Contractor accordingly.
                                        This release of retention shall be in lieu of the release of the second half
                                        of the Retention Money under the second paragraph of Sub-Clause
                                        14.9.

     Sub-Clause 14.15                   Currencies of Payment

     If all payments are to be made in Local Currency, it must be named in the Letter of Tender, and only
     the first sentence of this Sub-Clause will apply. Alternatively, the Sub-Clause may then be replaced:

     EXAMPLE SUB-CLAUSE FOR A SINGLE CURRENCY CONTRACT
                                        The currency of account shall be the Local Currency and all payments
                                        made in accordance with the Contract shall be in Local Currency. The
                                        Local Currency payments shall be fully convertible, except those for local
                                        costs. The percentage attributed to local costs shall be as stated in the
                                        Appendix to Tender.


Financing Arrangements

     For major contracts in some markets, there may be a need to secure finance from entities such as
     aid agencies, development banks, export credit agencies, or other international financing
     institutions. If financing is to be procured from any of these sources, the Particular Conditions may
     need to incorporate its special requirements. The exact wording will depend on the relevant
     institution, so reference will need to be made to them to ascertain their requirements, and to seek
     approval of the draft tender documents.

     These requirements may include tendering procedures which need to be adopted in order to render
     the eventual contract eligible for financing, and/or special Sub-Clauses which may need to be
     incorporated into the Particular Conditions. The following examples indicate some of the topics
     which the institution's requirements may cover:

     (a)     prohibition from discrimination against the shipping companies of any one country;

     (b)     ensuring that the Contract is subject to a widely-accepted neutral law;

     (c)     provision for arbitration under recognised international rules and at a neutral location;

     (d)     giving the Contractor the right to suspend/terminate in the event of default under the
             financing arrangements;

     (e)     restricting the right to reject Plant;

     (f)     specifying the payments due in the event of termination;

     (g)     specifying that the Contract does not become effective until certain conditions precedent have
             been satisfied, including pre-disbursement conditions for the financing arrangements; and

     (h)     obliging the Employer to make payments from his own resources if, for any reason, the
             funds under the financing arrangements are insufficient to meet the payments due to the
             Contractor, whether due to a default under the financing arrangements or otherwise.

     In addition, the financing institution or bank may wish the Contract to include references to the
     financing arrangements, especially if funding from more than one source is to be arranged to
     except: example text between lines may be copied                                                           15
     finance different elements of supply. It is not unusual for the Particular Conditions to include special
     provisions identifying different categories of Plant and specifying the documents to be presented to
     the relevant financing institution to obtain payment. If the financing institution's requirements are not
     met, it may be difficult (or even impossible) to secure suitable financing for the project, and/or the
     institution may decline to provide finance for part or all of the Contract.

     However, where the financing is not tied to the export of goods and services from any particular
     country but is simply provided by commercial banks lending to the Employer, those banks may be
     concerned to ensure that the Contractor's rights are very restricted. These banks may wish the
     Contract to exclude any reference to the financing arrangements, and/or to restrict the Contractor's
     rights under Clause 16.

     FORM OF SUB-CLAUSE WHICH A FINANCING INSTITUTION MAY REQUIRE

                                        The Accepted Contract Amount is made up as follows:

                                        (breakdown into items and/or into supply/delivery/etc)

                                        and shall be payable by the Employer to the Contractor as set out below.

                                        (a)            % of the Accepted Contract Amount shall be payable by a
                                                direct payment from the Employer to the Contractor within 28
                                                days of receipt by the Employer of the following documents:

                                                        the amount of the payment now due,
                                                (ii)    advance payment security guarantee issued by
                                                        Bank in the form annexed,
                                                (iii)   performance security guarantee issued by          Bank
                                                        in the form annexed, and
                                                (iv)    Interim Payment Certificate confirming the payment due
                                                        and specifying the amount.

                                        (b)            % of the contract price for the supply of Plant shall be
                                                payable as follows:

                                                (i)              % of the estimated contract value of the Plant
                                                        supplied, by direct payment from the Employer to the
                                                        Contractor on shipment of each item, against the following
                                                        documents:
                                                               (original) commercial invoice,
                                                               (original) shipping documents,
                                                               (original) certificate of origin,
                                                               (original) insurance certificate, and
                                                               (original) Interim Payment Certificate confirming the
                                                                   payment due and specifying the amount.

                                                (ii)             % of the estimated contract value of the Plant
                                                        supplied, by disbursement from the Loan Agreement to the
                                                        Contractor on shipment of each item, on presentation of a
                                                        Qualifying Certificate in the form annexed and copies of the
                                                        documents listed in sub-paragraph (b)(i) above.

                                                (i)            % of the estimated contract value of the services
16   except: example text between lines may be copied
                                                   rendered, by direct payment from the Employer to the
                                                   Contractor on execution of the relevant service, against the
                                                   following documents:
                                                          (original) commercial invoice, and
                                                          (original) Interim Payment Certificate confirming the
                                                              payment due and specifying the amount.

                                            (ii)           % of the estimated contract value of the services
                                                   rendered, by disbursement from the Loan Agreement to
                                                   the Contractor, on presentation of a Qualifying Certificate in
                                                   the form annexed and copies of the documents listed in
                                                   sub-paragraph (c)(i) above.

                                   (d)      The direct payments by the Employer specified in sub-paragraph
                                            (b) shall be made by an irrevocable letter of credit established by
                                            the Employer in favour of the Contractor and confirmed by a bank
                                            acceptable to the Contractor.

The above arrangements (involving financing institution(s), Employer and Contractor) may be
initiated by the Employer; or by the Contractor, before submitting the Tender. Alternatively, the
Contractor may be prepared to initiate financing arrangements and retain responsibility for them,
although he would probably be unable or unwilling to provide finance from his own resources. His
financing bank's requirements would then affect his attitude in contract negotiations. They might
well require the Employer to make interim payments, although a large proportion of the Contract
Price might be withheld until the Works are complete.

This payment arrangement can be achieved either by a high Percentage of Retention; or by a
suitably completed schedule of payments (see Sub-Clause 14.4), with the Instructions to Tenderers
specifying the criteria with which the Tenderer should comply. Since the Contractor would then
have to arrange his own financing to cover the shortfall between the payments and his outgoings,
he (and his financing bank) would probably require some form of security, guaranteeing payment
when due.

It may be appropriate for the Employer, when preparing the tender documents, to anticipate the
latter requirement by undertaking to provide a guarantee for the element of payment which the
Contractor is to receive when the Works are complete. The acceptable form(s) of guarantee should
be included in the tender documents, annexed to the Particular Conditions: an example form is
annexed to this document, as Annex G. The following Sub-Clause may be added.

EXAMPLE PROVISIONS FOR CONTRACTOR FINANCE

                                   The Employer shall obtain (at his cost) a payment guarantee in the
                                   amount and currencies, and provided by an entity, as stated in the
                                   Appendix to Tender. The Employer shall deliver the guarantee to the
                                   Contractor within 28 days after both Parties have entered into the
                                   Contract Agreement. The guarantee shall be in the form annexed to
                                   these Particular Conditions, or in another form acceptable to the
                                   Contractor. Unless and until the Contractor receives the guarantee, the
                                   Engineer shall not give the notice under Sub-Clause 8.1.

                                   The guarantee shall be returned to the Employer at the earliest of the
                                   following dates:

                                   (a)      when the Contractor has been paid the Accepted Contract Amount;

                                   (b)      when obligations under the guarantee expire or have been

        Sub-Clause 15.2                     Termination by Employer

        Before inviting tenders, the Employer should verify that the wording of this Sub-Clause, and each
        anticipated ground for termination, is consistent with the law governing the Contract.

        Sub-Clause 15.5                     Employer's Entitlement to Termination

        Unless inconsistent with the requirements of the Employer and/or financing institutions, a further
        sentence may be added.

        EXAMPLE                             Insert at the end of Sub-Clause 15.5:

                                            The Employer shall also pay to the Contractor the amount of any other
                                            loss or damage resulting from this termination.

        Sub-Clause 16.2                     Termination by Contractor

        Before inviting tenders, the Employer should verify that the wording of this Sub-Clause is consistent
        with the law governing the Contract. The Contractor should verify that each anticipated ground for
        termination is consistent with such law.


     Clause 17                              Risk and Responsibility

        Additional Sub-Clause Use of Employer's Accommodation/Facilities

        If the Contractor is to occupy the Employer's facilities temporarily, an additional sub-clause may be
        added:

        EXAMPLE SUB-CLAUSE
                                            The Contractor shall take full responsibility for the care of the items
                                            detailed below, from the respective dates of use or occupation by the
                                            Contractor, up to the respective dates of hand-over or cessation of
                                            occupation (where hand-over or cessation of occupation may take
                                            place after the date stated in the Taking-Over Certificate for the
                                            Works):

                                            (insert details)

                                            If any loss or damage happens to any of the above items while the
                                            Contractor is responsible for their care, arising from any cause
                                            whatsoever other than those for which the Employer is liable, the
                                            Contractor shall, at his own cost, rectify the loss or damage to the
18       except: example text between lines may be copied
                                      satisfaction of the Engineer.


Clause 18                             Insurance
   The wording in the General Conditions describes the insurances which are to be arranged by the
   "insuring Party", who is to be the Contractor unless otherwise stated in the Particular Conditions.
   Insurances so provided by the Contractor are to be consistent with the general terms agreed with
   the Employer. The Instructions to Tenderers may therefore require tenderers to provide details of the
   proposed terms.

   If the Employer is to arrange any of the insurances under this Clause, the tender documents should
   include details as an annex to the Particular Conditions (so that tenderers can estimate what other
   insurances they wish to have for their own protection), including the conditions, limits, exceptions
   and deductibles; preferably in the form of a copy of each policy. The Employer may find it difficult
   to effect the insurances described in the third paragraph of Sub-Clause 18.2 (for Contractor's
   Equipment, which includes Subcontractor's equipment), because the Employer may not know the
   amount or value of these items of equipment. The following sentence may be included in the
   Particular Conditions:

   EXAMPLE                            Delete the final paragraph of Sub-Clause 18.2 and substitute:
                                      However, the insurances described in the first two paragraphs of Sub-
                                      Clause 18.2 shall be effected and maintained by the Employer as
                                      insuring Party, and not by the Contractor.



Clause 19                             Force Majeure
   Before inviting tenders, the Employer should verify that the wording of this Clause is compatible with
   the law governing the Contract.


Clause 20                             Claims, Disputes and Arbitration
   Sub-Clause 20.2                    Appointment of the Dispute Adjudication Board

   Unless the Engineer (although appointed by the Employer) is to make the pre-arbitral decisions
   under this Clause 20, in accordance with the alternative option described below, the Contract
   should include the provisions under Clause 20 which, whilst not discouraging the Parties from
   reaching agreement on disputes as the works proceed, allow them to refer contentious matters to
   an impartial dispute adjudication board ("DAB").

   The adjudication procedure depends for its success on, amongst other things, the Parties'
   confidence in the agreed individual(s) who will serve on the DAB. Therefore, it is essential that
   candidates for this position are not imposed by either Party on the other Party; and that, if the
   individual is selected under Sub-Clause 20.3, the selection is made by a wholly impartial entity.
   FIDIC is prepared to perform this role, if this authority has been delegated in accordance with the
   example wording in the Appendix to Tender.

   It is preferable, but not essential, for the individual(s) to be agreed before the Letter of Acceptance
   is issued, and for the DAB to visit the Site on a regular basis. Under the example text in the
   Appendix to Tender, the Parties may either so agree before the Letter of Acceptance is issued or
   agree the appointment within the specified period thereafter. Alternatively, the Parties may prefer
   to defer the appointment until a dispute has arisen, in which case Sub-Clause 20.2 plus the
   Appendix - General Conditions of Dispute Adjudication Agreement with its Annex (Procedural
   Rules) and the Dispute Adjudication Agreement should be amended to comply with the wording
   except: example text between lines may be copied                                                     19
     contained in the corresponding sections of FIDIC’s Conditions of Contract for Plant and Design -
     Build.

     Sub-Clause 20.2 provides for two alternative arrangements for the DAB:

     (a)     one person, who acts as the sole member of the DAB, having entered into a tripartite
             agreement with both Parties; or

     (b)     a DAB of three persons, each of whom has entered into a tripartite agreement with both Parties.

     The form of this tripartite agreement could be one of the two alternatives shown at the end of this
     publication, as appropriate to the arrangement adopted. Both of these forms incorporate (by
     reference) the General Conditions of Dispute Adjudication Agreement, which are included as the
     Appendix to the General Conditions because they are also referred to in Sub-Clause 20.2. Under
     either of these alternative forms of Dispute Adjudication Agreement, each individual person is
     referred to as a Member.

     At an early stage, consideration should be given as to whether a one-person or three-person DAB
     is preferable for a particular project, taking account of its size, duration and the fields of expertise
     which will be involved. For some projects, it may be considered appropriate to appoint a one-
     person DAB for each major field of expertise relevant to the Works; however, this may give rise to
     problems if, when a dispute arises, the Parties cannot agree which field is applicable and, there-
     fore, to whom the dispute should be referred.

     For a one-person DAB to be mutually agreed, the Employer (or the tenderer) could propose the
     names and curriculum vitae of suitable persons, for the tenderer (or the Employer) to accept. It may
     be advisable to propose alternates in case some subsequently decline the appointment, assuming
     that they have not previously indicated their willingness to accept. Each Party may be reluctant to
     choose names from a list of people who have already been contacted by the other Party.

     For a three-person DAB, the Employer and the tenderer may each propose one member, similar to
     the above procedure, for the tenderer and the Employer respectively to accept. For the chairman, the
     Employer (or the tenderer) could similarly propose suitable persons for the tenderer (or the Employer)
     to accept. It may be appropriate for the chairman's retainer fee to be more than that of the other two
     members, reflecting the additional administrative tasks which a chairman will have to perform.

     The appointment of the DAB may be facilitated, especially if the members are not to be appointed
     at the commencement of the Contract, by including an agreed list of potential members in the
     Contract: in a Schedule.

     Alternatively, the Engineer may make these pre-arbitral decisions. This alternative, which has been
     the Engineer's traditional role in common law countries, may be appropriate if the Engineer is an
     independent professional consulting engineer with the experience and resources required for the
     administration of all aspects of the contract. The Employer should recognise that, although the
     Engineer generally acts for the Employer as specified in Sub-Clause 3.1(a), the Engineer will make
     these pre-arbitral decisions impartially and the Employer must not prejudice this impartiality. If this
     alternative is considered appropriate, the Sub-Clause may be varied:

     EXAMPLE SUB-CLAUSE FOR PRE-ARBITRAL DECISIONS BY THE ENGINEER
                                        Delete Sub-Clauses 20.2 and 20.3.

                                        Delete the second paragraph of Sub-Clause 20.4 and substitute:

                                        The Engineer shall act as the DAB in accordance with this Sub-Clause
                                        20.4, acting fairly, impartially and at the cost of the Employer. In the event
                                        that the Employer intends to replace the Engineer, the Employer's notice
                                        under Sub-Clause 3.4 shall include detailed proposals for the
20   except: example text between lines may be copied
                                   appointment of a replacement DAB.

Sub-Clause 20.5                    Amicable Settlement

The provisions of this Sub-Clause are intended to encourage the parties to settle a dispute
amicably, without the need for arbitration: for example, by direct negotiation, conciliation, mediation,
or other forms of alternative dispute resolution. Amicable settlement procedures often depend, for
their success, on confidentiality and on both Parties' acceptance of the procedure. Therefore,
neither Party should seek to impose the procedure on the other Party.

Sub-Clause 20.6                    Arbitration

The Contract should include provisions for the resolution by international arbitration of any disputes
which are not resolved amicably. In international contracts, international commercial arbitration has
numerous advantages over litigation in national courts, and may be more acceptable to the Parties.

Careful consideration should be given to ensuring that the international arbitration rules chosen are
compatible with the provisions of Clause 20 and with the other elements to be set out in the
Appendix to Tender. The Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the "ICC",
which is based at 38 Cours Albert 1er, 75008 Paris, France) are frequently included in international
contracts. In the absence of specific stipulations as to the number of arbitrators and the place of
arbitration, the International Court of Arbitration of the ICC will decide on the number of arbitrators
(typically three in any substantial construction dispute) and on the place of arbitration.

If the UNCITRAL (or other non-ICC) arbitration rules are preferred, it may be necessary to designate,
in the Appendix to Tender, an institution to appoint the arbitrators or to administer the arbitration,
unless the institution is named (and their role specified) in the arbitration rules. It may also be
necessary to ensure, before so designating an institution in the Appendix to Tender, that it is
prepared to appoint or administer.

For major projects tendered internationally, it is desirable that the place of arbitration be situated in
a country other than that of the Employer or Contractor. This country should have a modern and
liberal arbitration law and should have ratified a bilateral or multilateral convention (such as the 1958
New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards), or both, that
would facilitate the enforcement of an arbitral award in the states of the Parties.

It may be considered desirable in some cases for other Parties to be joined into any arbitration
between the Parties, thereby creating a multi-party arbitration. While this may be feasible, multi-
party arbitration clauses require skilful drafting, and usually need to be prepared on a case-by-case
basis. No satisfactory standard form of multi-party arbitration clause for international use has yet
been developed.

     Annexes            FORMS OF SECURITIES


     Acceptable form(s) of security should be included in the tender documents: for Annex A and/or B,
     in the Instructions to Tenderers; and for Annexes C to G, annexed to the Particular Conditions. The
     following example forms, which (except for Annex A) incorporate Uniform Rules published by the
     International Chamber of Commerce (the "ICC", which is based at 38 Cours Albert 1er, 75008
     Paris, France), may have to be amended to comply with the applicable law. Although the ICC
     publishes guides to these Uniform Rules, legal advice should be taken before the securities are
     written. Note that the guaranteed amounts should be quoted in all the currencies, as specified in
     the Contract, in which the guarantor pays the beneficiary.

We have been informed that                         (hereinafter called the "Contractor") is submitting
an offer for such Contract in response to your invitation, and that the conditions of your invitation
require his offer to be supported by a parent company guarantee.

In consideration of you, the Employer, awarding the Contract to the Contractor, we (name of parent
company)                         irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee to you, as a primary
obligation, the due performance of all the Contractor's obligations and liabilities under the Contract,
including the Contractor's compliance with all its terms and conditions according to their true intent
and meaning.

If the Contractor fails to so perform his obligations and liabilities and comply with the Contract, we
will indemnify the Employer against and from all damages, losses and expenses (including legal fees
and expenses) which arise from any such failure for which the Contractor is liable to the Employer
under the Contract.

This guarantee shall come into full force and effect when the Contract comes into full force and
effect. If the Contract does not come into full force and effect within a year of the date of this
guarantee, or if you demonstrate that you do not intend to enter into the Contract with the
Contractor, this guarantee shall be void and ineffective. This guarantee shall continue in full force
and effect until all the Contractor's obligations and liabilities under the Contract have been
discharged, when this guarantee shall expire and shall be returned to us, and our liability hereunder
shall be discharged absolutely.

This guarantee shall apply and be supplemental to the Contract as amended or varied by the
Employer and the Contractor from time to time. We hereby authorise them to agree any such
amendment or variation, the due performance of which and compliance with which by the
Contractor are likewise guaranteed hereunder. Our obligations and liabilities under this guarantee
shall not be discharged by any allowance of time or other indulgence whatsoever by the
Employer to the Contractor, or by any variation or suspension of the works to be executed under
the Contract, or by any amendments to the Contract or to the constitution of the Contractor or
the Employer, or by any other matters, whether with or without our knowledge or consent.

This guarantee shall be governed by the law of the same country (or other jurisdiction) as that which
governs the Contract and any dispute under this guarantee shall be finally settled under the Rules
of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by one or more arbitrators appointed in
accordance with such Rules. We confirm that the benefit of this guarantee may be assigned subject
only to the provisions for assignment of the Contract.
